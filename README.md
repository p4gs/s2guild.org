# SOC 2 Quality Guild

**Practitioner-driven standards for SOC 2 report reliability**

A community creating standardized evaluation criteria to help GRC and TPRM practitioners assess how much weight to give a SOC 2 report when making vendor trust decisions.

## What We Do

SOC 2 has become the most widely adopted security assurance framework for SaaS companies. But rapid growth in demand has created a quality gap — reports vary dramatically in rigor, and the ecosystem lacks standardized ways to tell the difference.

**The SOC 2 Quality Guild provides:**
- 📋 **[SOC 2 Reliability Rubric](https://s2guild.org/#rubric)** - 11 standardized signals across Structure, Substance, and Source
- 🛠️ **[Tactical Response Guide](https://s2guild.org/#responding)** - 8 practical approaches for addressing quality concerns
- 🤝 **[Community Projects](https://s2guild.org/#projects)** - Vote on and contribute to ecosystem improvements

## The Problem

TPRM teams make critical vendor trust decisions based on SOC 2 reports, but face fundamental challenges:

- **Quality varies widely** - from rigorous professional audits to compliance theater
- **No shared evaluation criteria** - practitioners rely on vibes, anecdotes, or brand recognition
- **Information asymmetry** - hard to distinguish high-quality audits from low-effort check-the-box exercises
- **Inconsistent decisions** - different teams assess the same report differently

This creates uncertainty for practitioners, inconsistent feedback for vendors, and an ecosystem that struggles to differentiate quality work.

## Our Approach

### SOC 2 Reliability Rubric

A practical framework with **11 signals across 3 pillars** to evaluate report quality:

#### 🟢 **Structure** (3 signals)
Does the report include required components and maintain professional consistency?
- S1: Required Auditor's Report Section Structure
- S2: Management's Assertion Completeness  
- S3: Inconsistent Language Across Report Sections

#### 🔵 **Substance** (4 signals)
Do the controls, testing, and conclusions logically align and support each other?
- S4: System Description Specificity
- S5: Control-to-Criteria Mapping Logic
- S6: Vague or Conflicting Control Descriptions
- S7: Test Procedure Detail and Specificity

#### 🟣 **Source** (4 signals)
What credentials, independence factors, and track record may affect report credibility?
- S8: CPA Firm Registration, Peer Review Enrollment & Results
- S9: CPA-to-SOC Reports Issued Ratio
- S10: CPA Firm Leadership & Report Signer Experience
- S11: Use of a GRC Tool

### Versioning Workflow

1. **Active Development** - Community discusses in shared Google Doc
2. **Consensus Decision** - Working group agrees changes are ready
3. **Version Lock** - Export to GitHub as new versioned release
4. **Changelog** - Document what changed and why
5. **Announcement** - Publish to community via Slack, website
6. **Iterate** - Continue refining in Google Doc for next version

This ensures practitioners have **stable references to cite** while enabling **ongoing collaborative improvement**.

## Principles

### Focus on Education, Not Accusations
We evaluate the **reliability of reports as evidence** — not the trustworthiness of individual vendors or auditors. Our frameworks provide repeatable, verifiable signals that any practitioner can apply.

### Practitioner-Driven
The Guild exists to serve practitioners making real vendor trust decisions. Community members set priorities through voting, discussion, and direct contribution.

### Market Pressure for Quality
By giving practitioners tools to consistently evaluate report quality, we create incentives that improve outcomes for everyone — vendors, auditors, and the organizations that rely on their work.

### Transparent and Open
Our work is open-source (CC BY-SA 4.0), community-governed, and built in public. Anyone can review, adapt, or build upon what we create.
